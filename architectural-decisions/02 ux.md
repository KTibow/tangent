## What should using Tangent feel like?

Tangent as a computer will be heavily inspired by GNOME. Some details that are pinned down:
- The overview will look very similar to GNOME's
- Due to tight space, the "activities" hot corner and app controls will be in one bar
- Modifier keys might be used in interesting ways, like repurposing a key as the equivalent of Super (since normal Super is handled by the host OS)
