# How will Tangent plug into everything?

Tangent as a computer has very ambitious goals regarding pluggability. Previous versions of Tangent only worked for one or two districts and stored everything for users. Tangent as a computer should be a lot more customizable and assume less.

## But first, identity

Emails will remain the primary form of identity and JWTs will remain the primary form of authentication; that's about the only thing staying the same.

## TODO

I need to have a good think about how to restructure things first. There are some really interesting things I could do with decentralization, using storage as a database instead of a database, etc, and it usually takes time to form a good model.
